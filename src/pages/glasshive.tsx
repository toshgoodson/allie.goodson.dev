			<h2>Creating Thoughtful Integration</h2>
			<Spacer size={16} />
			<p>As the lead design liaison for the FirstConnect Digital project, I guided a complex integration between a strategic third-party partner and our internal development team. By bridging technical and creative needs, I ensured the solution was designed and delivered seamlessly, resulting in a successful launch that earned strong recognition from the partner and showcased my ability to manage high-stakes, cross-functional collaborations.</p>
			<Spacer size={56} />
			<img src={mocksAndWidgetsImg} alt="Highlight of mocks and widgets from the comprehensive design flow"/>
			<Spacer size={56} />
			<p>To support this integration, I created comprehensive design flows and detailed specifications that addressed multiple user scenarios, including payment states, email communications, and widget behavior. By documenting UI call-outs and edge cases with clarity, I ensured engineers and partners had the guidance they needed to implement without ambiguity. This structured approach not only accelerated development but also reinforced consistency and usability across the product.</p>

						<h3>Calendar Redesign</h3>
						<Spacer size={16} />
						<p>I led the complete redesign of the calendar feature, transforming it from a static tool into a dynamic scheduling hub. This project addressed long-standing usability challenges while introducing powerful new capabilities such as integrated meeting scheduling, flexible daily and weekly views, and streamlined booking flows. The result was a tool that not only looked modern but also directly improved efficiency for users managing busy schedules.</p>
						<Spacer size={56} />
						<img src={calendarDesignImg} alt="Overview of the completed calendar redesign"/>
						<Spacer size={56} />
						<p>My process included analyzing user pain points, mapping out end-to-end scheduling scenarios, and creating detailed design flows that covered everything from widgets and overlays to booking links and automated emails. By optimizing navigation and visual hierarchy, I made it easier for users to switch contexts, coordinate meetings, and stay on top of their commitments. The redesign significantly enhanced both functionality and satisfaction, positioning the calendar as a core productivity driver within the platform.</p>

						<h2>Beyond Major Projects</h2>
						<Spacer size={16} />
						<p>In addition to leading large-scale initiatives, I also drove impactful improvements that strengthened both our product and design practice. I led the company-wide migration from Adobe XD to Figma, ensuring a smooth transition that quickly met business needs and improved collaboration across teams. This shift allowed design and development teams to stay productive with minimal disruption while unlocking immediate workflow efficiencies.</p>
						
						<p>I also took initiative to address critical bugs, errors, and inconsistencies across the app. By partnering closely with developers, I delivered quality-of-life improvements that resulted in a more stable, reliable productâ€”directly contributing to user satisfaction and retention.</p>

						<p>These efforts highlight my dependability and adaptability. Whether guiding complex integrations, redesigning core features, or tackling cross-team challenges, I consistently had my hands in many aspects of the GlassHive project, ensuring that both users and the business saw meaningful results.</p>
